        NEW YORK —During the summer when New York City was hit hard by COVID-19, NYC Parks instructed their maintenance and operations staff to document large crowds in city parks and educate patrons about social distancing. </a>

        <br />
        <br />
        “We are proud of the social distancing education our staff accomplished over the summer, which included efforts from our dedicated team of Social Distancing Ambassadors, Maintenance and Operations staff—a small subset of the overall program—
        and our Parks Enforcement Patrol officers and Urban Park Rangers whose education efforts continue across the city,” said NYC Parks spokesperson Dan Kastanis in an email.
        <br />
        <br />
        Parks maintenance and operations staff also logged whether park patrons complied or ignored social distancing guidelines after being approached by staff. The map below shows the percentage of interactions that resulted with patrons practicing
        social distancing in each community district.
        <br />
        <br />
        Manhattan had the best average compliance rate with 65 percent. Queens had lowest compliance rate at 16 percent.
